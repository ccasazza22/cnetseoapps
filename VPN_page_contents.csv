## What is the best VPN in 2024?"
"ExpressVPN holds the CNET Editors' Choice Award for best overall VPN. It's a
tight race between our top three choices, but ExpressVPN's service excels when
it comes to privacy and usability, making it the best of the best with an
8.8/10 rating. It offers unmatched transparency with a clear, user-focused
privacy policy, and its Trusted Server technology goes a step beyond"
"traditional RAM-only principles, resulting in maximum peace of mind when it
comes to your browsing data."
"Its Lightway protocol offers consistently fast speeds alongside post-quantum
protection, cleanly blending performance and security. Using ExpressVPN's
service is a breeze, reliably unblocking streaming content and offering useful
security features with its Advanced Protection suite.

Screenshot by CNET"
"Surfshark is a great choice for folks seeking practical privacy features on a
budget. It offers connection speeds and features comparable to ExpressVPN and
NordVPN but at an annual rate that's considerably cheaper ($42 for the first
year or $60 total for the first two years, then $60 a year after the
promotional period, versus $100 regular yearly prices for ExpressVPN and"
"NordVPN). Surfshark also offers support on unlimited devices, which makes it a
great option for people with large families or just a lot of connected
devices. There's even an Apple TV app for easy streaming in the living room.
It doesn't quite match ExpressVPN's commitment to privacy, which makes it less
suited for people with critical privacy needs."
Screenshot by CNET
"NordVPN is an excellent feature-packed VPN. NordVPN's connection speeds were
the very fastest we tested, with CNET Labs clocking a best-in-class 11.1%
average internet download speed loss. It offers double VPN, as well as Onion
Over VPN for extra encryption and Meshnet for secure file sharing, alongside
more standard features like split tunneling to let you decide which online"
"activities need VPN protection. Most people won't need all of those options,
but they're nice inclusions for power users. Overall, NordVPN offers a high-
performing service with excellent features for people who want advanced
privacy protection."
"Screenshot by CNET

Each VPN service we recommend has excellent value for a specific use case, and
we point out the ideal user for each one. The array of options available means
there's a VPN service suited to your needs, whether your privacy needs are
casual or critical. Also, consider jumping on one of the best VPN deals
currently available, which many of our top picks are offering.

## Factors to consider in a VPN"
**Internet speed loss**
"VPNs somewhat lower your internet speed because you're routing your traffic
through an encrypted server before communicating with apps, websites and other
internet services rather than a direct connection. The fastest VPNs feature an
average download speed loss of 25% or less. Generally, even folks with slower
connections -- like satellite internet -- won't notice a marginal 25% or under
dip. For bandwidth-intensive applications like gaming, 4K video streaming or"
"uploading large files, you'll want a VPN with minimal speed loss. Casual users
with faster internet speeds should be fine with more than 25% speed loss, but
we look for VPNs that keep speed loss below 50%."
"In our 2024 testing, NordVPN came out on top with an impressively low 11%
average internet speed loss. Mullvad, Surfshark, Proton VPN and Express VPN
all clocked an average internet download speed loss of 25% or less.

## CNET speed test data"
"This table shows the speeds we experienced in our testing. Your speeds will
vary depending on factors like your internet service plan and connection type.
The percentage of speed lost is intended as a general indicator of how much
the VPN slows down your connection; lower numbers represent a faster overall
connection."
"Provider | Avg. VPN speed (Mbps)| Avg. non-VPN speed (Mbps)| Speed loss  
---|---|---|---  
ExpressVPN | 173| 231| 25%  
Surfshark | 153| 193| 17%  
NordVPN | 206| 230| 11%  
Proton VPN | 157| 180| 21%  
IPVanish | 205| 367| 44%"
"PIA | 98| 211| 49%  
Mullvad | 319| 369| 13%  
  
**Privacy**"
"VPNs bolster your privacy by masking your IP address, which, like your
physical address, indicates identifying information about your geographical
location. At a minimum, we recommend a VPN with 256-bit encryption (for
OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPN protocols) or ChaCha20 (with WireGuard), a strict no-
logging policy and DNS leak protection. Because logging is tough to verify,"
"look for regular third-party audits. (You can and _should_ be skeptical of
your VPN provider's zero-log claims)."
"Additionally, transparency reports offer peace of mind. We also suggest
sticking with a VPN that includes a kill switch. More privacy-concerned users
like investigative journalists or political activists will appreciate advanced
features such as obfuscation (which makes it harder for ISPs to determine that
you're using a VPN), Tor over VPN (for additional encryption using the Tor
network) and a double VPN (which relies on a second VPN server connection to"
"enhance encryption). Folks with critical privacy needs should consider a VPN
provider with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or Fourteen Eyes
intelligence-sharing communities for even stronger peace of mind."
"**Server network**

When considering VPN server networks, look at the overall number of servers,
as well as the individual country locations. For instance, one virtual private
network company may have twice the total number of servers as a competitor but
half the different country locations, meaning you've got fewer international
choices. At the high end, the most comprehensive VPNs for travel offer 90-plus
individual countries, but anywhere over 60 countries will work for many folks."
"Outside of country locations, some VPNs allow file sharing across all servers,
whereas others feature dedicated P2P (peer-to-peer) options. For purposes like
torrenting, check whether your desired provider permits file sharing on all
servers or select ones."
"Additionally, you'll sometimes find specialty servers, like Tor (The Onion
Router) over TPN, Double VPN or obfuscated servers. Onion over VPN and Double
VPN servers provide extra privacy by bolstering your encryption even further
when compared with a standard VPN connection, with Tor using the Onion network
while a double VPN relies on a second VPN tunnel. On the other hand,
obfuscated servers make it more difficult for apps, websites or internet"
service providers to determine that you're using a VPN.
**Device support**
"Think about your devices and what you'd like to run a VPN on. Most VPN
companies offer apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS
and web browsers. Apple TV apps are increasingly common, with ExpressVPN,
NordVPN and IPVanish featuring TVOS applications. A graphical user interface
application may be easier for Linux users than a command line interface"
"option. Surfshark, Proton and PIA boast Linux GUI apps, making them compelling
choices for Linux VPNs. You can typically install a VPN on your router for
whole-home coverage and use it on devices that don't support native VPN apps,
like Xbox consoles, although this will typically void the warranty on the
router."
"While most VPN companies let you install an app on as many gadgets as you
wish, you're sometimes limited to simultaneous devices. ExpressVPN allows
eight, while NordVPN and Proton give you 10. Surfshark, PIA and IPVanish are
unlimited. Even with a provider like Express, Proton or Nord, you can still
install a VPN on as many devices as you wish, but you'll be able to have only"
"a handful of active sessions at once. Most folks should be fine even with
eight to 10 simultaneous connections, but families or hardcore power users may
feel constrained."
"## VPN device compatibility

Wondering which VPN services work on which devices? We've got you covered."
"| IPVanish| Surfshark| PIA| ProtonVPN| ExpressVPN| NordVPN  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Windows | ✔️| ✔️| ✔️| ✔️| ✔️| ✔️

"Browser plugin** | ✔️| ✔️| ✔️| ✔️| ✔️| ✔️  
Simultaneous connections | Unlimited| Unlimited| Unlimited| 10| 8| 10  
  
**Streaming capabilities**"
"While VPNs can be great for privacy, they're also helpful for unblocking
region-restricted entertainment content. You can use a VPN to watch streaming
services like Max or Hulu from your home country when traveling abroad. On the
flip side, VPNs unlock access to foreign Netflix (so you can get your
Bridgerton fix), Disney Plus (so you can stream The Acolyte all you like) and"
"Amazon Prime Video (where you can currently find Oppenheimer in the US)
libraries."
**Cost**
"You can sign up for a monthly, bi-annual, annual or multi-year VPN
subscription. Although multi-year deals typically net you the most savings, we
usually recommend sticking with an annual plan for the best savings with the
lowest risk. The virtual private network you sign up for may initially be
fast, private and great for geo-unblocking, but may become slower, suffer a"
data breach or stop allowing access to foreign Netflix libraries over a year.
"On the high end, VPNs such as Express set you back $100 per year, with value-
packed providers like Surfshark and PIA offering year-long prices from $40 to
$60. Some companies include price hikes: NordVPN normally charges $60 annually
for your first year, then your plan renews at $100 per 12 months. Similarly,"
"Surfshark goes for $48 a year upfront, then renews at $60 annually. Make a
budget, then find a VPN provider that fits the bill while being mindful of
price hikes. Notably, you can renew while avoiding raised renewal rates by
taking advantage of seasonal discounts like Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals."
"### Additional VPN factors to consider

Don't use free VPN providers: Except for Proton, you'll find only paid VPN
options on this list above because they're the only ones we can recommend."
"Look for a no-logs VPN, but understand the caveats: The best VPNs keep as few
logs as possible and make them as anonymous as possible, so there's little
data to provide should authorities come knocking. Even ""no-logs"" VPNs aren't
100% anonymous."
"There are limits to the privacy VPNs currently provide to iOS users: Recent
independent research has surfaced suggesting iPhones and iPads running iOS 14
or later may be vulnerable to device-only VPN leaks, regardless of which VPN
is used. Apple users concerned with potential leaks can take extra precautions
by installing their VPN on a home router to ensure their entire Wi-Fi network
is encrypted. Some iOS users may potentially reduce the likelihood of leaks"
"while outside of a home network by enabling their VPN's kill switch and
selecting OpenVPN protocols. You can also try closing all apps, activating
your VPN and then enabling and disabling Airplane Mode before using your
device normally. Apple advises users to activate their device's Always On VPN
profile for additional protection."
"VPN transparency is important, but warrant canaries are only the beginning:
Many services use ""warrant canaries"" to passively note to the public whether
or not they've been subpoenaed by a government entity. This is because many
investigations from national security agencies can't be actively disclosed by
law. Like the no-logging issue, warrant canaries aren't always as
straightforward as they seem. You should spend more time investigating whether"
"your prospective VPN has cooperated with authorities in the past, and how and
when it's disclosed that fact."
"Think twice about using a US-based VPN: The Patriot Act is still the law of
the land in the US, and that means US-based VPNs have little recourse if and
when the feds show up with subpoenas or national security letters in hand
demanding access to servers, VPN user accounts or other data. Yes, they may
have little data to access if the service has a strong no-logs policy, but why"
"not just choose a service that's based outside Uncle Sam's jurisdiction? (If
this is a concern for you, you'll also want to avoid countries with which the
US has intelligence-sharing agreements.)"
## About VPNs
"A VPN, or virtual private network, is an online service available as a mobile
app, desktop app, browser extension or other software that encrypts your
internet traffic to boost your privacy online. A VPN also prevents your
internet service provider from tracking which websites or apps you're using
and stops most of those websites and apps from seeing your actual geographic
location, allowing you to bypass content blocks in some countries to access"
"critical news and educational information. Additionally, VPNs are great for
unblocking geo-protected content like accessing foreign Netflix libraries. We
strongly recommend using a good VPN for everyday use as well as for work,
particularly if your work involves handling sensitive information."
"The best VPNs deliver a strong level of privacy protection without
compromising on performance, particularly internet speeds. At CNET, we
rigorously test each VPN across major platforms to find the ones that provide
exceptional privacy, reliability, speed and value. This list is constantly
being updated as we actively test VPNs and look at the latest research, so
expect this guide to change throughout the year as we put each VPN through its"
"paces. We've recently retested Surfshark, ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Private
Internet Access, Proton, IPVanish and Mullvad from the ground up."

## How we test VPNs"
"Our hands-on testing and review process is designed to cut through that hype.
When we look at each VPN service, we're not just examining them for their
technical weaknesses, but we're also scrutinizing their individual performance
strengths. We want to know what each service does best. We test each VPN
across over 20 factors, and we continually improve our methodology as we learn
more. Our rigorous testing process involves running over 250 internet speed"
"tests across multiple worldwide servers to determine accurate internet speed
loss averages."
"We test VPNs for browsing and streaming speed in multiple countries, as well
as their connection stability and even the smallest potential privacy leaks.
By testing across multiple devices and platforms, we're able to assess which
VPNs are best for gaming versus those best for streaming, torrenting or
sharing sensitive information. Most importantly, we focus on doing the deep-
dive research necessary to vet each VPN's historical credibility and its
ownership in a notoriously murky market."
"The VPNs on this list earn our recommendation for more than just boosting
their digital privacy strengths -- they enable easy streaming to overcome geo-
blocked media, have torrenting-friendly servers and are fast enough to support
gaming globally. Based on those continued evaluations, you'll see a few bullet
points on each entry in our list, highlighting each VPN's strengths and the
uses we recommend it for most. Because we strive to keep on top of a fast-"
"changing market, you'll notice that the rank of each VPN service changes as we
learn more and retest."

## How to choose the right VPN for you

Picking a VPN requires knowing two basic things to start with: What you want
to use it for, and what you're willing to pay. The range of VPN offerings is
vast, but those two things will help you find a VPN that has the right blend
of speed, security and cost."
"Below, you'll find specific FAQ sections on picking a VPN based on the most
common needs: gaming, streaming media, working from home and privacy-critical
professions. In general, you'll want a VPN that provides sufficient
encryption, doesn't log your activity, offers essential security features like
DNS leak protection and a kill switch, has server locations where you need
them and can give you fast connection speeds. Our top five VPNs have all these"
"features, although connection speeds will vary based on your internet provider
and the server you connect to."
"For a deeper dive, check our detailed walk-through of how we evaluate and
review VPNs. If you're looking for some quick pointers, here are universally
applicable advice guides for beginners:

## Other VPNs we've tested"
"Not every VPN can be a favorite. These are the ones we reviewed, but they're
not full-throated recommendations for one reason or another, including limited
features and concerns over adequately hiding your identity.

### IPVanish"
"IPVanish is a decent beginner-friendly VPN for folks seeking basic privacy. It
does a good job unblocking geographically protected streaming content on
multiple services, such as providing access to foreign Netflix libraries. We
liked its intuitive VPN apps which, while easy to use even for novices,
weren't quite as streamlined as apps from NordVPN or ExpressVPN. While you get
privacy fundamentals from IPVanish, its US jurisdiction makes it unsuitable"
"for people with critical privacy needs, like political activists,
investigative journalists or asylum-seekers."
"Its comparatively slow speeds -- we measured a 44% average internet speed loss
-- severely lagged behind NordVPN (11%), Surfshark (17%), Proton VPN (21%) and
ExpressVPN (25%). Likewise, its relatively small server network of 56
countries is head and shoulders below Nord (111 countries), ExpressVPN (105)
countries, Surfshark (100 countries), Proton (91 countries) and PIA (91"
"countries). IPVanish sets you back $13 per month, $48 for your first year or
$72 for two years combined -- but the one- and two-year plans jump to $90
annually after your introductory pricing period. For the price, you can get a
VPN with faster internet speed maintenance and a much larger web of servers."

"### Hotspot Shield

Hotspot Shield VPN's TLS-based Hydra Catapult protocol, US jurisdiction,
128-bit AES encryption support and large percentage of virtual servers might
strip away our trust in its ability to provide more privacy protections than
its competitors. Those are all key components to its ability to achieve the
blazing speeds it delivered during its most recent speed tests."
"It effortlessly delivers smooth-streaming media and can dance between server
connections without missing a beat, no matter how many interruptions you throw
at it. A 26% speed loss puts it in second place, falling behind Surfshark
(which lost just 16.9% of its speed the last time I tested it) and knocking
Express down to third place with a 51.8% speed loss at the last measurement."
"Speed losses on UK connections were under 8%. When it comes to gaming,
torrenting, browsing and streaming, these speed-dependent services won't be
slowed down for Hotspot Shield users."
"We're not excited about Hotspot's privacy and security. Since the services use
a closed-source proprietary Catapult Hydra protocol, instead of the more
transparent open-source OpenVPN protocol, we'd like to see Hotspot give the
public more third-party audits, which is a necessary step to bring Hotspot up
to speed with routinely audited VPNs like TunnelBear. As recently as April"
"2021, review site VPNMentor discovered a DNS leak in Hotspot Shield's plug-in
for Google Chrome. Hotspot acknowledged the issue at the time and aimed to
improve the product."
"We're also not thrilled about the amount of user data Hotspot collects and its
privacy policy. With its premium product, it gathers and retains much more
information about users than most other VPNs. If you're using the free version
of its product, it shares that information -- along with even more finite
data, including your MAC address and specific phone identifier -- with
advertising companies."
"While its interface is user-friendly and its speeds are thrilling, spending
time with Hotspot is going to leave your wallet a little lighter than you
might prefer. Its current price is higher than its nearest competitors, its
speeds slightly slower and its privacy more questionable. If you're looking
for a VPN purely on the grounds of speed, we still recommend passing on
Hotspot until it improves."

  * Platforms: Windows, Android, MacOS, iOS, Linux, Amazon Fire TV
  * Price: $8 per month or $95.88 billed annually. Month-to-month plan at $13  

### TunnelBear"
"TunnelBear has gotten a lot of hype in the last couple of years. When we
looked under its hood and compared it with its VPN competitors, our excitement
waned."
"TunnelBear's speeds are reasonable. We lost nearly 63% of internet speed
overall when we used it, which is about average for a VPN. TunnelBear's speeds
have steadily improved over the years as measured by other review and testing
sites, and the US scores we recorded saw a speed loss of only 54%."
"On the plus side, TunnelBear is holding its own in the transparency
competition among VPNs by publishing the results of its independent security
audits and annual transparency reports. No IP address, DNS or other
potentially user-identifying data leaks were detected during our testing, but
in the past TunnelBear was observed to have been leaking WebRTC information.
TunnelBear's VPN encryption is standard AES-256 and it supports Perfect
Forward Secrecy."
"It's also a Canadian business owned by US-based McAfee, so if you're looking
for subpoena-proof international online privacy, you're playing with fire. It
holds a paltry 23 server locations from which you can't manually choose your
VPN server or even a city. It doesn't offer Tor-over-VPN, it offers split
tunneling only on Android and it can't even unblock Netflix."
"On a per-month breakdown, the least expensive TunnelBear plan is its $120,
three-year plan. You can also go month to month for $10, or pay $60 upfront
for a single year. Either way, TunnelBear accepts payment via credit card and
Bitcoin. Unlike other VPNs, it doesn't take PayPal, plus it doesn't support
Amazon Fire Stick or Android TV."

### CyberGhost VPN"
"In CNET's previous coverage of virtual private networks, we've praised
CyberGhost for its roster of competitive features. Our in-depth review of
CyberGhost in 2019 included speed testing, security verification and an
analysis of its full suite of privacy tools. Since then, the VPN company has
increased its number of servers and is prepared to roll out new privacy tools,"
"all while remaining one of the cheapest VPNs we've reviewed, at just $2.03 per
month for a two-year plan."
"As we've bolstered our approach to VPN reviews, CyberGhost has raised some red
flags. Its parent company's history warrants skepticism, our previous tests
have shown it to expose your VPN use to your ISP, its website and app trackers
are more numerous than warranted and its ad blocker uses an untrustworthy
method of traffic manipulation no VPN should even think about. Its low price
previously made it worth considering if you needed to change the appearance of"
"your location online, but not if you wanted best-in-class security."
"While CyberGhost's connection speed and security features appear to be
improving, we don't currently recommend using the VPN service provider if
you're in a country where VPNs are illegal. We also recommend that anyone in
the US review CyberGhost's parent company before deciding whether to pay for a
subscription."
"On the plus side, CyberGhost was still faster than Norton Secure VPN and less
taxing on the processing power of our devices. It also offers split tunneling
in its Windows client and has its servers neatly organized into categories:
NoSpy servers, servers geared for torrenting, servers best for streaming and
servers best for use with a static IP address. CyberGhost imposes no data
caps, allows unlimited server switching and offers a 45-day money-back"
guarantee on subscription plans of a year or more.

  * Number of simultaneous connections: 7
  * $2.03 a month or $60 for a two-year plan (plus four free months). Month-to-month plan at $13.

### Norton Secure VPN"
"Norton LifeLock, long known for excellence in security products, has a
relatively limited offering in its VPN product. Norton Secure VPN does not
support P2P or BitTorrent, Linux, routers or set-top boxes. It's Netflix and
streaming compatibility is somewhat limited. Even worse, during testing, we
experienced privacy-compromising data leaks."
"During CNET's testing, Norton Secure VPN speeds were comparable to other mid-
tier VPNs but not particularly competitive. Although its VPN is only available
on four platforms -- Mac, iOS, Windows and Android -- Norton gets points for
its 24/7 live customer service phone support and 60-day money-back guarantee."
"Norton Secure VPN's pricing structure is a bit different than what you
typically find in the industry. Pricing is tiered based on how many
simultaneous connections you want with your account. For a single device,
you'll pay $30 for the first year and $50 for any subsequent years, or $4.99 a
month for the monthly. For five simultaneous connections, the price jumps to"
"$40 for the first year and $80 for subsequent years, or $8 a month for the
monthly plan. If you want up to 10 simultaneous connections, the price is $60
for the first year and $100 for subsequent years, or $10 a month for the
monthly plan."

### Mullvad"
"Mullvad is an independently owned and open-source VPN provider focused on
building trust through transparency with its commitment to protecting the
privacy and security of its users. Although some other VPNs are considerably
more well known in the industry, Mullvad's offering is just as polished and
easy to use as what's offered by many of the market's bigger players."
"Mullvad's primary focus is on security. Like most other top VPN providers,
Mullvad employs industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption, using the OpenVPN
protocol or ChaCha20 on WireGuard, to secure users' connections. Mullvad's
kill switch feature and DNS leak protection are enabled by default and can't
be disabled. During our testing, the kill switch worked as expected and we"
"detected no leaks of any kind. The company says it doesn't keep any logs of
its users' activity, and for the most part it's pretty transparent about how
it operates and what it does to protect user privacy. Mullvad is unique in
that it doesn't require any personal information at sign-up. While most VPN
providers ask users to provide an email address and enter a username, Mullvad"
"generates a random 16-digit account number to activate each new user account.
You don't even need to provide any payment information since Mullvad accepts
cash sent via mail."
"Mullvad's source code being entirely open source is a testament to the
company's transparency, but we'd still like to see Mullvad issue an annual
transparency report to give the public a view of how many legal requests the
company gets and where they're coming from. But you don't just have to take
Mullvad's word for it: Radically Open Security confirmed Mullvad's no-logs"
assertions in a 2023 independent audit.
"With 684 servers across 44 countries, Mullvad's VPN server network is
comparatively small. Even so, the network covers the most in-demand locations
and is pretty well spread out across the globe. What its network may lack in
size, it makes up for in speed. In our latest round of speed testing, we
measured just a 13.5% drop in average internet speeds (VPNs will slow you down"
"50% or more), easily making it one of the fastest VPNs we've tested. Although
Mullvad's speeds are fantastic, it's not the best for streaming geographically
restricted content. We were able to access Netflix and Disney Plus without any
issues but were denied access to stream Amazon Prime Video when connected to
Mullvad's servers -- it recognized that we were using a VPN."
"Mullvad's straightforward approach to pricing is a breath of fresh air,
especially with so many other VPN providers concocting ever-more convoluted
pricing structures. Mullvad costs about $5 a month, whether you want to use it
for a month, a year or a decade, and you're never locked into a long-term
subscription plan. If you're not satisfied with the service, you can get a"
refund within 30 days of purchase.

## Other VPNs our experts are reviewing"
"Below you'll find some additional VPNs. We're in the process of re-evaluating
them in the coming months.

### PureVPN

PureVPN says it doesn't log connection information. The company joined the ""no
log"" movement in 2018 and underwent a third-party audit by Althius IT (albeit
one commissioned and paid for by PureVPN)."
"We like that PureVPN offers a 31-day refund policy and supports Bitcoin
payments. We also like that PureVPN has both Kodi and Chromebook apps
available. In addition, PureVPN was the first VPN service we noted to fully
implement GDPR compliance.

  * Country/jurisdiction: Hong Kong
  * $3.24 a month for one-year plan, $1.99 a month for a two-year plan (plus three free months)

### StrongVPN"
"StrongVPN blasts onto our list with excellent infrastructure and a decent
price. StrongVPN has a strong no-logging policy and picks up kudos for its
large base of IP addresses. It has a solid collection of servers and worldwide
locations. For those of you who need a dedicated IP, you can get one from the
company but you'll need to contact customer support to get help setting it up."
"One of StrongVPN's strengths is the company's network. It owns and operates
its entire network infrastructure, which means it has no externally dictated
limits on bandwidth or the type of internet traffic allowed on the network.

StrongVPN's regular monthly price of $10.99 is in the middle of the pack, but
its regular yearly price of $80 is among the lowest of our contenders.

## VPN FAQs"
"In today's hyper-connected world, online privacy and security are increasingly
critical. From online banking to communicating remotely with colleagues, we're
transferring more data on our computers and smartphones than ever before. Much
of that data is confidential information that we need to keep safe from
hackers and snoops, so VPN use is on the rise as people take steps to secure
their digital lives.

### Do I need a VPN?"
"Anyone who accesses the internet from a computer, tablet or smartphone can
benefit from using a VPN. You don't have to be an activist, government
dissident or journalist to need a VPN; the rise of third-party data brokers,
cross-site advertising trackers, IP address collection and mobile geo-
targeting have all combined to create an online browsing environment that
poses significant threats to everyday users' basic privacy. Because a VPN"
"encrypts your connection, your browsing data is protected from your internet
service provider (and any government entities who request your ISP data), and
your network administrator in most cases. A VPN can also shield your private
information -- like passwords, usernames and bank or shopping details -- from
anyone snooping on your network."
"Show more

### What is the best free VPN?"
"Proton VPN's free tier is the only free VPN we've come across so far that's
worth using. It costs a lot of money to operate a VPN, and free VPN services
usually make up for the lack of subscription revenue by selling user data. In
addition to being limited in usability and light on security, many free VPNs
are fronts for malware distribution, which is why it's generally best to avoid"
"them. Proton VPN's unlimited free tier is fast and secure and can be used for
most online activities, including streaming Netflix. If you're on a budget and
want access to a premium VPN solution, you can also take a look at our picks
for the best cheap VPNs."
"Show more

### What is a mobile VPN?"
"A mobile VPN is simply a VPN you can use on your mobile device like your
iPhone or Android phone. All of the providers we recommend have mobile
versions of their desktop clients. You can use a mobile-focused VPN app to
ensure greater data privacy designed for your whole device. Mobile VPNs also
generally have a smaller memory footprint and require less processing power
than desktop VPNs, so they tend to yield faster connection speeds and don't"
"eat up your battery as quickly. Keep in mind that most mobile VPN clients will
use a lighter form of encryption than a desktop client to achieve those
smartphone speeds. Be sure to check your VPN apps' settings to ensure you're
using the apps' strongest encryption if your privacy needs are heightened. Our
top three VPN picks all have excellent, easy-to-use mobile VPN app options for
their services. Some VPNs will only work with one type of mobile platform --"
"like iOS or Android -- and some are universally compatible. To find the right
mobile VPN for you, check out our mobile-specific VPN guides below. We
routinely update them with our retesting information, so check back often."

### Are VPNs legal?

VPNs are perfectly legal to use in most countries. There's nothing wrong with
taking steps to protect your privacy online, and you shouldn't have to worry
that using a VPN as part of that process will get you in any kind of legal
trouble."
"There are countries where VPNs are either banned or outright illegal. If
you're using a VPN in a country like China, Iran, Oman, Russia, Turkmenistan,
UAE or Belarus, you may find yourself in legal trouble. The irony here is that
these are the countries where internet censorship and surveillance are most
common. In those countries, you'll need to make sure you use a VPN that"
"provides strong obfuscation so your VPN traffic is disguised as ordinary HTTPS
traffic, meaning government entities won't even know you're using a VPN in the
first place."
"You won't run into any trouble with the law for using a VPN across most of the
world. One important reminder: VPNs are legal in most places, but **engaging
in illegal activity online is still illegal regardless of whether you 're
using a VPN**.

### How do I use a VPN for Netflix?"
"If you live in a country that censors its media or are traveling to one, geo-
restricted content is a pain. You can use a VPN to circumvent censorship or
access your home country's normal media content for an online streaming
service like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video or Disney Plus. Pick a VPN that
lets you manually select which country you want to connect through and has
something called obfuscation. (Our top three picks offer this.) You don't"
"always need to use the obfuscation feature to unblock Netflix, but since
streaming services actively try to block VPN connections, obfuscation can help
because it disguises your VPN traffic as regular internet traffic."
"If you're looking to try out other VPNs, choose one with a large number of IP
addresses, preferably 10,000 or more. This is because one of the ways Netflix
and others block VPNs is by blacklisting known VPN IPs, and if your VPN has
tens of thousands of IPs, there's a better chance that you'll be able to
connect to an IP address that Netflix hasn't flagged."
"Once you have your VPN installed, connect to the country whose content you
wish to view, restart your browser and go to the streaming site. If your VPN
is working, the site should treat you as a resident of your selected country
and serve you content assigned to that audience. If you're still having
trouble, you can try using incognito mode on your browser or try clearing your
cookies and cache.

"### How do I know if my VPN is working?

Your first and most apparent indication that your VPN is working is that your
IP address will change and your location will be registered as that of the VPN
server you're connecting through. You can check this on a site like
whatismyipaddress.com."
"You'll also want to make sure your VPN is protecting your privacy and not
leaking any of your data outside of the VPN tunnel, thus exposing it to your
ISP and other entities that may be monitoring your online activity. You can
check for leaks by going to a site like dnsleaktest.com or ipleak.net. If your
location is registered as the VPN server location and your leak tests turn up"
"negative, then you know your VPN is working to protect your privacy."

### What is a remote-access VPN?"
"A remote-access VPN uses public infrastructure like the internet to provide
remote users secure access to their network. This is particularly important
for organizations and their corporate networks. It's crucial when employees
connect to a public hotspot and use the internet for sending work-related
emails. A VPN client on the user's computer or mobile device connects to a VPN
gateway on the company's network. This gateway will typically require the"
"device to authenticate its identity. It will then create a network link back
to the device that allows it to reach internal network resources such as file
servers, printers and intranets as if it were on the same local network."
"Show more

### What is a site-to-site VPN?"
"This is when the VPN technology uses a gateway device to connect the entire
network in one location to a network in another location. The majority of
site-to-site VPNs that connect over the internet use IPsec. IPsec-based
encryption protocols are often considered by VPN specialists to be less secure
against modern surveillance. Rather than using the public internet, it is also
normal to use multiprotocol label-switching clouds as the main transport for"
site-to-site VPNs.
"VPNs are often defined between specific computers, and in most cases, they are
servers in separate data centers. New hybrid-access situations have now
transformed the VPN gateway in the cloud, typically with a secure link from
the cloud service provider into the internal network.

### What's the best VPN?

The best VPN for you depends on your needs when using a VPN."
"**VPNs for crucial privacy and security  
** If you're a journalist, a lawyer or a professional in any other privacy-
sensitive field, forget about speed and price when choosing a VPN. Focus,
instead, entirely on security. Your VPN may be somewhat slower but, for both
VPNs and presidential motorcades, speed is always the trade-off for privacy.
Avoid free VPNs and browser-based VPNs. If you're concerned with government"
"monitoring in your current country, choose a VPN headquartered outside of the
country you're currently in, and avoid choosing a VPN with a jurisdiction in
an allied country. For example, US journalists should avoid VPNs with a
jurisdiction in the US or other Five Eyes countries. Keep an eye on
encryption: Your VPN should offer a protocol called OpenVPN TCP (for its"
"mobile apps, IKEv2 is fine). Right now, the VPN we recommend most for critical
privacy is ExpressVPN."
"**VPNs for working from home  
** If you're working from home, you may be sharing your internet connection
with multiple devices and family members or roommates. That's a lot of
simultaneous connections to a VPN and a lot of drag on a network. Pick a VPN
that lets you use one subscription on as many devices as possible and has
excellent speeds so your Wi-Fi isn't bogged down. If your job involves"
"handling sensitive information like financial or medical records, your
priority VPN criteria is security. Our top three VPN picks are the most secure
we've found, and each has a different number of connections they'll allow for
a base-level subscription. Depending on your budget and home office
requirements, ExpressVPN, Surfshark and NordVPN are all great options for
working from home. There are a few other factors worth considering for a home"
"office VPN, so check out our guide to picking the right VPN for working at
home."
"**VPNs for gaming  
** Most VPNs are chosen based on having a good balance of speed, security and
cost. If you want a VPN specifically to connect to game servers in another
country, speed is everything. Free VPNs won't be fast enough; fortunately,
high-end security won't be a cost driver, which gives you more options at
modest prices. Since all VPNs reduce speed \-- many by half or more -- that"
"means picking one from the set that performed best in our speed tests. In our
latest tests, NordVPN took the lead as the fastest VPN, though you can get
excellent speeds through Surfshark via the WireGuard protocol and with
ExpressVPN. If you're focused on VPNs for game consoles, look at our best VPNs
for Xbox and our primer on installing them. Before choosing the one right for"
"your needs, visit the VPN's official website to see whether they offer servers
specifically aimed at gaming in the countries where you most want to connect
to other players."
